# Visualise the data
plot(precipitation_xts) # xts allow us to plot time-series 
hist(precipitation_xts, breaks = 30) # there are a lot of data points close to 0. It looks long tail. 
# we can check with mean() and max() and quantile(precipitation, 0.95) this suggests we need extreme analysis 
# seems to be right-skewed 
########## FIRST THING: what is the threshold? mrlplot is  ########## 
# MRL plot: 
mrlplot(precipitation_xts, main="Mean Residual Life Plot") # mean excess (straight line) and dashed line (confidence intervals)
# We need to select a threshold that it should look linear. We should take 40-45 (very linear)
# Find the lowest threshold where the plot is somewhat linear

# fitting the GPD model over a range of thresholds
threshrange.plot(precipitation_xts, r = c(30, 45), nint = 16) # you see the parameters for a specific threshold (between 30 and 45). Tradeoff between 
# variance and bias. It looks like the confidence interval is limited to 40. 
# nint is the number of threshold, r the range of the thresholds 
# ismev implementation is faster:
ismev::gpd.fitrange(precipitation_xts, umin=30, umax=45, nint = 16) # we use this one for part 3 
# set threshold
th <- 40 # you can see what quantile does this threshold represent. corresponds to 99 quantile-> quantile(precipation, 0.99)
## main assumption of the data: independence. 
# Visualise the threshold

rl_mle <- return.level(pot_mle, conf = 0.05, return.period= c(2,5,10,20,50,100), do.ci=T)
