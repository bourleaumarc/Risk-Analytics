<p>From the plot, we can discern that there are a total of 11 data points that surpass the 140 cm threshold, marked by the red line. The highest recorded sea level, occurring in 1966, is notably distinct as the peak value in the dataset, reaching 192 cm. When considering the distribution of the maximum values each year, there’s a hint of a potential trend in the data. Whether extreme values are stationary or not will be investigated in (D) using likelihood ratio test.</p>

<p>As anticipated, the simple approach leads to poor predictions, with confidence intervals spanning from 124 to 146. The main reason for this lackluster performance is the violation of key assumptions in linear modeling when dealing with extreme values, such as: linearity, homoescedasticity and increased sensitivity to outliers. Consequently, we will turn to specialized models rooted in the realm of extreme value theory to address these challenges more effectively.</p>

<p>As previously noted and showcased in the plot, the predictions of extreme values using a linear model exhibit significant shortcomings. The predicted values follow a linear pattern and consistently fall short of accurately capturing extreme events. There is one exception, the observation on the 13th of November 2019, for which the Confidence Interval of the predicted value aligns well with the actual value. Nonetheless, even in this case, the model underestimates the observed value by approximately 9 cm, a substantial deviation.</p>
<p>To address these limitations, we are turning to the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, a more suitable approach for modeling extreme events.</p>

<p>We initially observed that the shape parameter of the fixed Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model was close to 0. This suggested that the extreme values closely follow a Gumbel distribution, which is characterized by an exponential tail. To confirm this hypothesis, we calculated a confidence interval using the ci function in the extRemes package. The resulting confidence interval included 0, indicating that the shape parameter was not significantly different from 0.</p>
<p>Next, we aimed to fit a GEV model with time-varying location parameters. We explored two different functions: linear and harmonic. The linear function assumed that “Year” is treated as a linear predictor, and the location parameter is assumed to change linearly over time. However, the likelihood ratio test indicated that the fixed GEV model (stationary) was a better fit. This result made sense because while there were some patterns in the maximum values, the linear function did not capture the entire variability of the data.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the harmonic function, which is often used to model periodic phenomena, yielded a different outcome. It allowed us to reject the null hypothesis of the likelihood ratio test, indicating that the GEV model with time-varying location parameters was a better fit. This result suggested that our maximum values displayed non-stationary behavior.</p>

<p>Here, we can observe a trend slowly increasing from the predicted values. However, there is a noticeable problem with the method we used. Indeed, the confidence intervals are way too close to the return level, giving us bounds which are too narrow to observe anything significant. A more complete analysis would require a de-trending of the bootstrapped values, but we were limited by the time allowed to complete this work.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-broadly-speaking-each-year-there-is-a-chance-of-113-that-the-observed-value-is-above-the-13--years-return-level.-comment-the-results-for-both-the-linear-model-prediction-and-gev-approach.-note-that-12-of-the-20-events-occurred-in-the-21st-century.">(i) Broadly speaking, each year, there is a chance of 1/13 that the observed value is above the 13- years return level. Comment the results for both the linear model prediction and GEV approach. Note that 12 of the 20 events occurred in the 21st century.</h3>
<p>The main issue we see is that the observed values from 2010 to 2022 are much higher than the expected return level. This indicates that the models we are using are crucially underestimating how fast the sea level is currently rising, most notably the extreme values.</p>
<p>The linear model predictions did not give us something reliable enough, as it did not take into account its parameters varying. As a result, only one of the observed values is inside of the confidence intervals.</p>
<p>the return levels from the GEV model are giving us better results overall, but still far from the reality. If we imagine similarly wide confidence intervals for the GEV (ignoring the limitations we had) compared to the linear model, we could potentially have up to 6/8 values inside its bounds, which would be somewhat good, except for the two highest values (12/11/2019 and 22/11/2022), which are on a scope that wasn’t even imagined by the model.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the models we used until now were all incomplete, and could not predict the massive change the sea levels underwent, most notably in the latest 3 years where the values attained heights never seen before. This event can be explained through the effects of global warming, accelerating the pace at which the sea level rises worldwide.</p>

<p>To pinpoint the periods with the highest water levels, we’ve established a threshold of 326.91 meters (95% quantile). Upon analysis, the peak water level was observed in August 2007, surpassing this predefined threshold, with a value of 329.32 meters. Furthermore, in July 2021, there were many instances where the water levels exceeded the established threshold of 326.91 meters.</p>

<p>The histogram reveals a right-skewed distribution, indicating a higher frequency of lower water level readings and a gradual decrease in frequency as the levels rise. Most of the observed water levels concentrate below 327 meters. Notably, the distribution’s tail extends to the right, suggesting infrequent occurrences of substantially elevated water levels. These exceptional values could represent sporadic episodes of extreme water conditions.</p>

<p>The peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach is a statistical method used to model extreme values in a dataset. It focuses on the tail of the distribution, where the extreme events reside. To model high water levels using the POT approach, I would follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Select a threshold</strong>: choose an appropriate threshold above which water level readings are considered extreme and above which the plot is roughly linear. This threshold should be high enough to exclude mundane variations but not so high that you have too few data points to model accurately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extracting exceedances</strong>: once the threshold is set, identify all the data points that exceed it. These are the “peaks” you will analyze. Use the mean excess plot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fitting a Distribution</strong>: fit a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) to the exceedances. The fitting can be done using maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian methods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parameter Estimation</strong>: which are the shape parameter (kappa), the scale parameter (sigma), and the location parameter (theta). These parameters define the behavior of the distribution’s tail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Diagnostics</strong>: after fitting the model, perform diagnostic checks to ensure that the GPD provides a good fit to the data: analyzing residual plots, conducting goodness-of-fit tests, and using plots comparing the empirical and theoretical exceedance probabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clustering:</strong> apply the Ferro-Segers estimate, using the <code>extremalindex</code> function in R, counts exceedances of a high threshold within time windows. A high extremal index (\&gt;1) suggests clustering of exceedances, indicating a need for declustering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Estimating Return Levels</strong>: estimate high quantiles (return levels) and their corresponding return periods. The return level is the value that is expected to be exceeded once every specific period (e.g., a 100-year flood level).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assessing Uncertainty</strong>: confidence intervals for the return levels can be constructed, use <code>confint</code>.</p></li>

How do you propose to measure and deal with clustering of the daily water levels?</h3>
<p>Clustering of extremes refers to the tendency of extreme events to occur in sequences or bursts rather than being uniformly distributed over time. This is particularly relevant in environmental data, such as water levels, where extreme events can be dependent on preceding conditions (ex: Chaux-de-fonds heavy rainfall during 3 days).</p>
<p>To measure and deal with clustering in daily water levels, we propose the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Measuring clustering</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Run Tests for Serial Dependence</strong>: use statistical tests like the autocorrelation function (ACF), or the Ljung-Box test to detect serial dependence in the data above the threshold.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Clusters</strong>: use the <code>extremalindex</code> function to determine whether. The “declustering” period—how much time must pass without an exceedance before a new cluster is defined—needs to be determined.</li>
<li><strong>Declustering Methods</strong>: apply declustering algorithms to separate the data into independent clusters of exceedances and intervening non-exceedances. A straightforward declustering method, is to use a for loopto identify and group extreme precipitation events by their occurrence in distinct years,and then use the <code>decluster</code> function from <code>extRemes</code> package.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Dealing with clustering:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Declustering the Data</strong>: before fitting a model to the exceedances, decluster the data to remove the influence of serial dependence. Each cluster may be represented by its maximum value.</li>
<li><strong>Modeling with Clustering</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intensity Measures</strong>: such as the mean number of exceedances per cluster or the average duration of clusters into the risk assessment.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Varying Thresholds</strong>: consider dynamic thresholds that adjust for seasonality or other known factors that influence clustering, rather than a fixed threshold.</li>
</ol>

<p>This threshold was determined by examining the mean residual life plot, where 326.9 meters emerged as a critical point where the mean excess values begin to show significant variation. This value represents a transition in the data, marking where the mean excess values start to widen noticeably. This observation is further substantiated by the fact that 326.9 meters corresponds to the 95th percentile of your dataset, indicating it is a level exceeded by only the top 5% of your observations.</p>

<p>For the raw data, the adherence of the points to the 1:1 line in the Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot suggests a superior fit compared to the declustered data. Furthermore, the lower AIC value for the raw data implies that it provides a more efficient balance between model complexity and goodness of fit. This indicates that the model for the raw data may be more appropriate for capturing the underlying distribution of the dataset.</p>
